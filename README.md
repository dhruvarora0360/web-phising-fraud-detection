🚀 Just completed my Web Phishing Fraud Detection Model using Machine Learning!

The model is designed to detect fraudulent websites based on extracted URL and webpage features.

🔍 Tech Stack: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
🧩 Algorithms Used: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree
📊 Model Accuracy: Achieved over 96% accuracy with Random Forest Classifier

This project aims to help in preventing online fraud and phishing attacks by classifying URLs as legitimate or phishing.

💡 I learned a lot about feature engineering, model evaluation, and real-world fraud prevention applications.
